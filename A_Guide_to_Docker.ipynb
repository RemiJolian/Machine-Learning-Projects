        "# Understanding Docker: A Beginner's Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Docker?\n",
        "Docker is a platform that allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container. This container can be run on any system that supports Docker, regardless of the operating system. Think of it as a portable, self-contained environment for your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is it popular?**\n",
        "* **Portability:** Docker containers can be easily moved between different environments (development, testing, production).\n",
        "* **Efficiency:** Docker containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them more lightweight than traditional virtual machines.\n",
        "* **Isolation:** Each container is isolated from others, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistency.\n",
        "* **Scalability:** Docker containers can be easily scaled up or down to meet demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Docker Architecture\n",
        "* **Docker Daemon:** The background service that manages Docker containers.\n",
        "* **Docker Client:** The interface you use to interact with the Docker daemon.\n",
        "* **Docker Images:** Read-only templates containing the instructions to build a Docker container.\n",
        "* **Docker Containers:** Running instances of a Docker image.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Docker Images\n",
        "Docker images are like blueprints for containers. They contain the application code, dependencies, and configuration files needed to create a container. You can create images from scratch or use pre-built images from Docker Hub.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Setting Up Your Docker Environment\n",
        "1. **Install Docker:** Download and install Docker for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
        "2. **Verify Installation:** Run `docker --version` in your terminal to check if Docker is installed correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Installing Docker (Windows)\n",
        "1. **Download:** Go to the Docker website and download the Docker Desktop installer for Windows.\n",
        "2. **Installation:** Follow the on-screen instructions to install Docker Desktop.\n",
        "3. **WSL2:** Make sure you have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) enabled.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Docker Development Workflow\n",
        "1. **Create an application:** Write your application code.\n",
        "2. **Create a Dockerfile:** Write a Dockerfile that specifies the base image, dependencies, and commands to build the container.\n",
        "3. **Build the image:** Run `docker build -t my-image .` to build the image.\n",
        "4. **Run the container:** Run `docker run my-image` to start the container.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Creating a Simple App (Iris Prediction)\n",
        "**1. Create a Python file (iris_prediction.py):**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Import necessary libraries\n",
        "from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n",
        "from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree # try export_graphviz\n",
        "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
        "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

        "# Load the iris dataset\n",
        "iris = load_iris()\n",

        "# Create and train the decision tree classifier\n",
        "clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42) # try max_depth = 4 or... 8\n",
        "clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Evaluate the model\n",
        "accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)\n",
        "#accuracy = clf.score(X_train, y_train) ???\n",
        "\n",
        "print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Visualize the decision tree\n",
        "plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))\n",
        "plot_tree(clf, feature_names=iris.feature_names, class_names=iris.target_names, filled=True, rounded=True)\n",
        "plt.show()\n",

        "# Make a prediction\n",
        "sample = X_test[27].reshape(1, -1) # try X_test[0 or ...]\n",

        "print(prediction)\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Create a Dockerfile:**\n",
        "Create a new file named Dockerfile (without any extension) in the same directory\n",
        "```dockerfile\n",
        "# Use an official Python runtime as a base image\n",
        "FROM python:3.12-slim\n",
        "\n",
        "# Set the working directory in the container\n",
        "WORKDIR /app\n",

        "### Building and Running Docker Images\n",
        "* **Build:** `docker build -t my-image .` (replace `my-image` with your desired image name)\n",
        "* **Run:** `docker run my-image`\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding basic Linux commands\n",
        " It is crucial when using Docker.While Docker provides a user-friendly interface, many underlying operations still involve interacting with the Linux environment where the Docker daemon is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some reasons why Linux commands are essential:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Container Management:**\n",
        "  - **Starting, stopping, and removing containers:** Use commands like `docker start`, `docker stop`, and `docker rm`.\n",
        "  - **Listing running containers:** Use `docker ps`.\n",
        "  - **Listing all containers:** Use `docker ps -a`.\n",
        "* **Image Management:**\n",
        "  - **Building images:** Use `docker build`.\n",
        "  - **Listing images:** Use `docker images`.\n",
        "  - **Removing images:** Use `docker rmi`.\n",
        "* **Network Management:**\n",
        "  - **Creating and managing networks:** Use commands like `docker network create`.\n",
        "* **Volume Management:**\n",
        "  - **Creating and managing volumes:** Use commands like `docker volume create`.\n",
        "* **File System Operations:**\n",
        "  - **Copying files into and out of containers:** Use commands like `docker cp`.\n",
        "  - **Executing commands within containers:** Use `docker exec`.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Docker provides a higher-level abstraction, having a basic understanding of Linux commands will give you more control and flexibility when working with Docker containers and images.\n",
        "## Comment for my code:\n",
        "In a Docker container, running a graphical interface or displaying plots directly to the screen does not work the same way as it does on your local machine. By default, Docker containers do not have a display server configured, so for example matplotlib cannot open a window to show the plot.\n",
        "To handle this, we can save the plot to a file inside the container and then access the file:\n",
        "- plt.savefig('/app/iris_model_plot.png')  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** These are just a few essential commands. There are many more to explore as you delve deeper into Docker.\n"
